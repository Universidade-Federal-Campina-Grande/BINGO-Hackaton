    "Let us call $F(t)$ the Fourier transform of $f$ and $W$ the Fourier transform of the window function. This is the **frequency-domain**. $W$ is often called **FILTER**. (Actually this is a particular kinf of filter known as *Finite Response Filters - FIR*)\n",

    "in words: the convolution of two functions is equal to the inverse fourier transform of the pointwise products of the fourier transform of the functions. (Or convolution operation in time domain is mapped to pointwise product in frequency domain."
